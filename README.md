# Calculate Halstead Metrics

This project is intended to calculate the Halstead complexity metrics (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halstead_complexity_measures)



## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisities

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing


Clone the project to your local repository:
git clone https://ametwally@bitbucket.org/ametwally/hw1_ahmedmetwally.git


Navigate to the the project's main directory. Then build the project using gradle 
gradle build



To execute the program:
gradle execute




A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Stay what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo


Example: get a source code from https://sourceforge.net/ :
download it to any path



## Running the tests
There are couple of tests implemented in this program:
to test the program using the JUnit tests:
gradle test


### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

**TODO:**

* // print distinct number of operator and operand 
* /// Test public, non static, protected.
* /// LambdaExpression is added in JLS8 API
* /// catch enhanced for and if condition for the : 
* // catch switch for the :
* /// negative numbers counted as 
* /// the program count import statements as Operands
* /// Should we add the operators in different scopes as two different things
* // Count integer lateral numbers only only	
* // Check if the parameters are set or not before calculating any metric
* // make the original parameters valid for division
